| Feature           | Multithreading | Multiprocessing |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Definition**      | Creating and starting a new thread to execute a task within the same process. | Executing processes within a multi-core CPU. |
| **Cost**           | Less expensive to set up and use. | More expensive to set up and use. |
| **Handled By**     | Handled by an interpreter (CPython in Python). | Generally handled by the operating system. |
| **Memory Space**   | Works dependently, sharing memory space. | Works independently, having separate memory space. |
| **Best For**       | Input/output tasks such as database queries, web server requests, or any data processing involving shared data. | CPU-bound tasks such as high-level processing and scientific computations. |
| **Complexity**     | Less complex and easier to manage as it runs within the same process. | More complex since it runs on separate processes. |
| **Parallel Execution** | Due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true parallel execution is limited. | Achieves true parallel execution as each process has its own Python interpreter instance. |
| **Overhead**      | Lower overhead as threads share memory and resources. | Higher overhead due to inter-process communication and separate memory spaces. |
| **Fault Isolation** | A crashing thread may affect the entire process. | A crashing process does not affect others. |
| **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** | Easier since threads share the same memory space. | More complex as processes require IPC mechanisms like pipes, queues, or shared memory. |
| **Scalability**    | Limited scalability due to GIL in Python. | Scales better across multiple CPU cores. |
